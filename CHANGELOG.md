0.0.2
-----

This version introduces significant changes to the API, prompted by changes in the `script-monad` dependency. The main change is that `WebDriver` and `WebDriverT` have been replaced by `WebDriverT` and `WebDriverTT` and are a more sensible monad transformer and monad transformer transformer, respectively. The main effect of this is that (1) `WebDriver*` types take an extra parameter for the effect monad, and (2) functions for working with `WebDriver*` now have additional `Monad` and `MonadTrans` constraints. The library will now only compile with GHC >=8.6 due to a transitive dependency on `QuantifiedConstraints`.

* Added
  * Browser preferences field on `FirefoxOptions` and `ChromeOptions`
  * `readDataFile`, `writeDataFile`, `readJsonFile`, and `writeJsonFile` data helpers
  * `breakpoint` and `breakpointWith` for helping with debugging; controlled by `breakpointsOn`, and `breakpointsOff`
  * `expectIs`
* Changed
  * Switched order of arguments for `elementSendKeys`, `getElementAttribute`, `getElementProperty`, and `getElementCssValue`. The element reference now comes last to make it easier to chain these with `>>=`.
  * `logDebug` and `logNotice`
  * Tested on geckodriver 0.23.0.
* Fixed
  * Bug in behavior of `cleanupOnError` was causing it to miss some errors, which left the remote end session open
